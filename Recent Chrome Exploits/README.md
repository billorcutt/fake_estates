This code requires a midi controller of some sort to trigger the sounds - I used an Akai MPD.

Note that this record predates the Cracked app so the code is wrapped in an HTML page that runs in the browser and has a UI of some sort. The included synth plugin was there for compatibilty with an older version of the cracked library.
